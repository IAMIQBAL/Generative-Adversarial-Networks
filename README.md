# Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository contains the architectures of different GANs that I have learned and implemented when I took GANs Specialization offered by DeepLearning.ai. I have experimented with various datasets as well and the results are attached inside the notebooks.
<br>
<br>
Apart from this, the repository also contains notes that I took during the specialization. I will keep the repository updated as I experiment with/implement new generative models' architectures **other than** the specialization.
